The clerk should use shell sort. Shell sort requires fewer swaps than either insertion or especially
selection sort.

The efficiency of selection sort is dramatically reduced by having only one extra slot:
  1. The current min crate is removed from its original position and stored in the extra slot.
  2. When a crate with a sooner shipping date is found, the current min crate is put back in its
     original position, and the new min crate is put in the extra space.
  3. Once the overall min crate is found, it is replaced in its original position.
  4. The crate it is to be swapped with is moved into the extra slot, and the min crate is moved to
     the empty position.
  5. The crate in the extra slot is then moved into the slot vacated by the min crate.
In the case where the first crate checked is the last to be shipped, 3n+4 moves are required to get
it to the correct position.

For the insertion sort:
  1. Remove the crate from its position.
  2. Move all adjecent crates with a greater shipping date one position along, filling the empty space.
  3. Put the initial crate into the space left by shifting the other crates.
In the worst case, when the current crate must be moved to the opposite end of the warehouse, this
totals n+1 moves.

Shell sort further improves on the performance of insertion sort by repeatedly h-sorting the
warehouse. The steps involved to move a crate into the correct position are as described by
insertion sort.
