6. All keys identical
Selection sort requires n(n-1)/2 compares and n-1 swaps.
Insertion sort requires n-1 compares only.
Insertion sort is faster.

7. Reverse order
Selection sort requires n(n-1)/2 compares and n-1 swaps.
Insertion sort requires n(n-1)/2 compares and n(n-1)/2 swaps for a total of n(n-1) operations.
Selection sort is faster for all n > 2.
